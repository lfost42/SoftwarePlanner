## WALKTHROUGH

Minimal Viable Product
- User can create PROJECT, REQUIREMENT, TASK
- User can create LISTs under PROJECT, REQUIREMENT, TASK

Other planned features
- PROJECT - Projects can be broken down into separate Requirements and further into Tasks.
	-- each PROJECT VIEW >> option to see -list of LISTs and TASKS
	-- each TASK VIEW >> -list of LISTs and TICKETs

- User access - allows users to assign notes and tasks to other users
- PROJECTs and TASKs assignments: assign to TEAM/TEAM or TEAM/USER (default is SELF). 
- Roles - project creators can delete or rename their project and lists other users can append notes to tickets or file a ticket to a project, requirement, or task
- CRUD Projects, Requirement, Task, User, Team
- Lists - used to draft and organize Project, Requirements, and Tasks. Items must be inserted into a Ticket to assign to another user. 
- Tickets - may be attached under PROJECT, REQUIREMENT, or TASK; NOTEs appended to Tickets. Each Ticket contains a list of NOTEs
- Attachments - may be attached to PROJECT, REQUIREMENT, TASK, and TICKETs
- Change history for PROJECT, REQUIREMENT, and TASK CRUD history
- Notification/Alerts when items are ASSIGNED and DUE
- Sort, Search, Filter projects, tasks, notes

DASHBOARD STATISTICS
- How many REQUIREMENTs/TASKs/TICKETs in PROJECT are
	-- complete 
	-- past due
	-- on time
	-- outstanding

Project Export notes - csv file

A REQUIREMENT may contain a list of TASKs. 
A PROJECT, REQUIREMENT, and TASK may contain a list of TICKETs.
A TICKET is a list of NOTEs.
